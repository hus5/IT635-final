# IT635-final

The Project includes an e-commerce website (WordPress) based, that is focused on selling Accessory items like Cell Phone Cases, Headphones, Laptop Bag etc.

To set up this website, I have installed and configured the following.
1. NginX Webserver
2. MySQL
3. PHP
4. WordPress

After successfully installing WordPress, I have setup an Admin User
which will be used to create low privileged user (Read Only) to search and order
the items.

Also have created a test user who would see the website as a regular website, without additional priviledge.

The Features include:
Admin Screen:
1. Home page: Posts showing recently added products and prices.
2. Products page: Contains products of sale. Will need to click next to see next item.
3. About page: Information about the owner and company.
4. Contact us page: Customer support phone number.

This also features a User Login view where
1. A user can search products by name, keyword.
2. See the product information.
